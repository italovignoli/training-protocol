# A taxonomy of user skills related to LibreOffice

### Basic User

All software functions are pre-determined or commonly used, and techniques for input, manipulation and output are straightforward or routine.

### Intermediate User

Functions are at times non-routine or unfamiliar, the choice of techniques needs to take into account a number of factors, and the user has some responsibility in the input, manipulation and output of the information.

### Advanced User

Functions are complex and may involve looking for a tool to solve a problem, exploring technical support, self-teaching and applying what you have learned. Techniques are multi-step, and the process of selecting them may involve research, identification and application. The user has full responsibility for the input, manipulation and output of the information.

### Guidelines for LibreOffice training courses

LibreOffice training courses are usually targeted to three different user groups:

1. Individual users willing to improve their skills, either at basic, intermediate or advanced level. In general, these users follow a training course organized by a professional school, and do not have specific needs which impact on the training program.
2. Corporate users of LibreOffice, where the organization wants to improve the skills related to office productivity. In general, these users have specific needs related to the application scenario, and therefore the training should be personalized according to their needs. In order to design an appropriate training program, it is important to work extensively with the human resource department, to assess needs and evaluate results.
3. Corporate users of Microsoft Office migrating to LibreOffice. In general, these users have some understanding of office suites - often self-taught - as they have been using a similar product for years, but are facing a change in their workflow which might create severe acceptance problems. In order to design an appropriate training program, it is important to work with the project manager and the human resource department, to assess needs and evaluate results.
