# Designing Training Programs

Training refers to the planned effort to facilitate the learning of job-related competencies, and is a key component of every LibreOffice enterprise deployment. The goal of training is for users to master the knowledge, skills and behaviour emphasized in training programs and to apply them to their day-to-day activities.

Every training starts with a design process. As there is not one universally accepted training development model, we will be using as a reference the seven step Instructional System Design \(ISD\), which is also referred as the ADDIE training model because it includes analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.

1. Conduct a needs assessment, which is necessary to identify whether training is needed.
2. Ensure that employees have the motivation and skills necessary to master the training content.
3. Create a learning environment that has the features necessary for learning to occur.
4. Ensure that trainees apply the training content to their jobs, and understand how to manage skill improvement as well as getting peer and manager support.
5. Develop an evaluation plan, by identifying what types of outcomes training is expected to influence \(for example: learning, behaviour, skills\), and choosing an evaluation design that allows you to determine the influence of training on these outcomes.
6. Choose the training method, based on the learning objectives and the environment. This step may include a traditional training method of face-to-face interaction with a trainer or e-learning using CD-ROM or Web-based training.

Evaluate the program, make the necessary changes, and revisit any of the earlier steps in the process to improve the program so that learning, behaviour, change, and the other learning objectives are obtained.

A good instructional design requires an iterative process of design, execution, evaluation and reconsideration of the needs that the program was designed to meet, as well as the learning environment, the transfer of training, and all the other activities in the process. Because of this, any instructional model should be considered as a set of general guidelines that trainers need to follow to ensure effective training.
